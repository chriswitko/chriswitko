### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris. I am the creator of ManualTesting.dev. I built this tool to help people like you and me to improve our manual testing process, organise tests, manage cases, control bug reporting and issues. It helped me a lot in my daily work as a software developer. If you have any questions, feel free to reach me via email chris@manualtesting.dev.
